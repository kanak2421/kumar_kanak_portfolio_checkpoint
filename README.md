# My portfolio work

Website without animation feels like cake without sugar.
However, animation keeps the website alive even when
it’s old and also it keeps audience engage with the website
and that makes the website unique.
 
 ##My portfolio website for the checkpoint
 
  I would be using black and red colour for the website as layout
  
 
• Further, for my website I would keep all my buttons with
the hover effect so that every page should be visited by
the audience.

• The next animation which I would prefer to do in my
website would be focus animation, so that when we click
at any picture the picture would zoom in and show that
would allow the view to drag and see the each part of the
picture with zoom in hand.

• Furthermore, I would want my picture to be in 3d effect
or with flip effect which would cover two pictures and by
clicking it the other pictures flips.

• Therefore, I would not make it flooded with lot of
animation but the typography and the colour would be
different according to The picture to place.
